# AVELO Master Execution Checklist

## Summary
This is the final master list for this thread. It is the only list we use going forward. We will strike items only when the item itself is complete, its proof-of-done check passes, and any dependency re-check required by that item also passes.

Release intent for the current thread:
- `v1.1` is the performance, accuracy, and reliability release.
- The release evidence must include repeatable local benchmark runs for core voucher/report paths and a million-voucher stress path, measured on the same machine with visible progress and comparable modes.

Execution rule:
- Work only from `Active Now`.
- When an item is done, strike it.
- When a dependency changes, re-check dependent completed items before moving forward.
- If scope changes, edit this list only. No side scope.
- Apply the release split in `Docs/Avelo_Release_Board.md`: `V1` for day-one correctness/open-save reliability, `V2` for post-launch merge/security/scale and benchmark tooling work, `V3` for later hardening and rare-edge-case resilience.

Status keys:
- `Owner`: `Code`, `Review`, `Test`, `Manual QA`, `Decision`
- `Depends`: prerequisite items that must be green first
- `Proof`: what must be true before striking the item

## RC Queue

- ~~Prove promoted shell routes for inventory, payroll, and banking behave as shipped features~~  
  Owner: `Test`  
  Depends: bundled app launch validation complete  
  Proof: sidebar, menu, keyboard, and command-palette navigation all resolve to the intended screens

- ~~Add a reproducible local `.app` bundle path~~  
  Owner: `Code`  
  Depends: release build green  
  Proof: `make bundle` produces `dist/Avelo.app`

- ~~Validate the bundled app launches cleanly for local RC~~  
  Owner: `Test`  
  Depends: local `.app` bundle path exists  
  Proof: the built app launches without an immediate startup crash

- ~~Re-run accountant-style QA on the built RC artifact~~  
  Owner: `Manual QA`  
  Depends: promoted shell routes validated  
  Proof: no shipped-path blocker found in the built artifact

- ~~Run RC stress, soak, and deployment validation~~  
  Owner: `Test`  
  Depends: built-artifact QA complete  
  Proof: no crash, corruption, or packaging blocker remains in local RC scope

## Worker Lane Status

- `ARCH`  
  What it is supposed to do: verify current release-path structure, module boundaries, deferred gating, and shipped-shell integrity for the built RC path.  
  Proof of done: structural report tied to current bundle/script surface and hidden/deferred entry-point state.  
  Current blocker: none proven; built RC path validated with bundle, self-test, launch smoke, and shipped-shell routing evidence.  
  Current task: verify the built RC path remains structurally sound after the last RC queue items are struck through.

- `FLOW`  
  What it is supposed to do: verify end-to-end shipped journeys on the built RC artifact.  
  Proof of done: built-artifact flow matrix for company setup, company switching, accounts, vouchers, FY lock, reports, backup, and restore.  
  Current blocker: none proven; built-artifact QA now has direct RC-flow and bundle/self-test evidence.  
  Current task: re-run accountant-style QA on `dist/Avelo.app`, using self-test coverage as baseline and manually confirming any journey not already proven.

- `QA`  
  What it is supposed to do: validate the shipped app surface as an accountant-style RC pass on the built artifact.  
  Proof of done: manual proof for launch, promoted shell routes, and accountant-critical bundled-app flows.  
  Current blocker: none proven; built-artifact QA now has direct RC-flow and bundle/self-test evidence.  
  Current task: hand off to RC stress, soak, and deployment validation completion.

- `TEST`  
  What it is supposed to do: classify automated RC evidence into already proven, re-run required, and still missing.  
  Proof of done: a green automated suite or a minimal failing set, plus an explicit RC evidence map for stress/soak/failure handling.  
  Current blocker: none proven; automated RC evidence now covers bundle validation, self-test, stress, and smoke.
  Current task: keep the RC evidence map in sync with the built artifact and release board.

- `DEPLOY`  
  What it is supposed to do: prove release build, bundle, launch, and local packaging readiness from current repo evidence.  
  Proof of done: release build, bundle validation, launch smoke, and self-test evidence reconciled against the current built artifact.  
  Current blocker: none proven; `swift build -c release`, `dist/Avelo.app`, `Scripts/validate_bundle.sh`, `Scripts/launch_smoke.sh`, and `Scripts/bundle_selftest.sh` now reconcile against the RC queue.  
  Current task: hand off to final ARCH go/no-go after the last RC queue items are struck through.

## Parallel Work Rules
- Safe parallel work in `B`: independent view-model migrations, but remove each holder only after its paired migration is green.
- Safe parallel work in `C`: schema table reconciliation can run in parallel by table family, but `schema_v1.sql` must not be finalized before migration review is complete.
- Safe parallel work in `D`: company/accounts/settings-backup reviews can run together; voucher create/edit/reverse should stay grouped.
- Safe parallel work in `F`: repository tests, service tests, and report tests can be added in parallel if they do not share fixtures or business-rule edits.
- No parallel work is allowed across items that mutate the same write-path, the same schema contract, or the same report contract.

## Re-Check Rules
- If schema changes after a repository item is struck through, re-check that repository item.
- If voucher write logic changes after a report item is struck through, re-check affected reports.
- If FY logic changes after a flow or report item is struck through, re-check those items.
- If restore logic changes after company or report items are struck through, re-check those items.
- If shell observation changes after a flow item is struck through, re-check the affected UI flow.
