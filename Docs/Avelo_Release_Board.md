# AVELO Release Board

This is the repo-tracked `P0/P1/P2` execution board for the release push. Each open issue appears once, carries one severity, and maps back to the master execution checklist.

Current release target:
- `v1.1` is the performance, accuracy, and reliability hardening release.
- The current benchmark focus is on repeatable local measurement for cold launch, core voucher/report paths, backup/restore, soak, stress, and million-voucher runs on the same machine and dataset.

Severity rules:
- `P0`: release-blocking correctness, data integrity, fiscal lock, restore, or core offline-behavior risk
- `P1`: high-priority shipped-path gap that can cause broken workflow, bad UX trust, or incomplete validation
- `P2`: lower-priority release work, deferrable module decisions, or hardening/polish items that do not block core correctness by themselves

Module ship status:
- `Core ship`: company setup, company switching, FYs, accounts, vouchers, reports, inventory, payroll, banking, audit, backup/restore, offline shell
- `Conditional`: none in the current local RC shell
- `Deferred`: invoice/PDF printing, bill-wise ageing/interest, TDS/TCS/cheque/bill-allocation UI, PO/SO order-tracking, cash flow statement, stock ageing/reorder alerts, group-company consolidation, and GST export flows beyond current summary/report preparation, including invoice-wise GSTR-1 portal upload data

Release split rule:
- If it affects correctness, data loss, or the app's ability to open and save reliably on day one, it belongs in `V1`.
- If it improves offline merge, security, scale, or benchmark tooling but does not block launch, it belongs in `V2`.
- If it is mainly enterprise hardening, resilience polish, or rare-edge-case protection, it belongs in `V3`.

## Release Split

### V1: Must Ship
- Fail loudly on malformed UUIDs instead of substituting fresh IDs. Status: done in shipped repository, registry, and report-decode paths with regression coverage.
- Keep restore safe and deterministic; minimize mutation during restore and preserve checksum verification.
- Preserve core correctness guarantees already in place: WAL, foreign keys, transactions, locked fiscal years, audit immutability, company isolation.
- Add basic handling for missing or moved company files that gives a clear recovery path or explicit re-link workflow. Status: core open and backup paths now honor registry `sqlite_file_name`, preserve a legacy `id.sqlite` fallback, and fail with explicit re-link or restore guidance when the registered file is missing.
- Add minimum viability checks for permissions, disk-full, and backup-write failures so the app fails cleanly.
- Prevent obvious large-ledger or report slow paths that would make core accounting unusable at launch.

### V2: Should Ship After Launch
- Migrate from plain UUIDs to UUIDv7 for time-sortable IDs and better offline merge behavior.
- Add stronger restore hardening and more explicit integrity verification around imported backups.
- Add basic large-dataset performance work: better pagination, query-plan tuning, prepared-statement reuse, and benchmark-driven regression checks.
- Add SQLCipher or equivalent at-rest encryption if product or security requirements demand it.
- Add clearer recovery for unusual filesystem cases like network volumes or antivirus locks.

### V3: Later Hardening / Scale Work
- Filesystem-type detection and FAT32-specific backup warnings.
- Thermal-throttling-aware UI behavior.
- `VACUUM` / `ANALYZE` automation and other maintenance jobs.
- Materialized rollups and advanced reporting acceleration.
- Deep UI virtualization and more aggressive memory-load shedding.
- Niche hardware-edge-case protections such as serial-port bounds checks or cosmic-ray-style fault mitigation.

Hidden entry-point rule:
- Conditional or deferred modules must not remain exposed in the shipped release path unless they pass the same gates as core ship.
- Current hidden-entry-point review targets: sidebar routes, command palette items, quick search hits, menu items, and sheet entry points for advanced GST export actions.

## Top 10 Blockers In Execution Order

1. No current release blockers proven from repo evidence

## Release-Risk Split

| Track | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V1 | Active | Day-one correctness, restore safety, file-open/save reliability, and launch viability risks stay here until closed. |
| V2 | Deferred until post-launch unless needed to unblock V1 | Merge behavior, stronger backup integrity, at-rest encryption, and broader scale tuning belong here. |
| V3 | Deferred | Edge-case resilience, maintenance automation, and deep scale or hardware hardening belong here. |

| RB-D46 | P1 | I/J | Added an integrated accountant RC flow test that creates and opens a real company, creates an account, posts/edits/reverses vouchers, locks FY, validates reports, and round-trips backup/restore end to end |
