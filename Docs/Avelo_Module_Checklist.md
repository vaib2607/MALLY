# Avelo Module Checklist

The file-by-file gap map and per-slice acceptance criteria. Every Swift file in the project is listed here. When a pass is complete, every file in that pass's slice is checked off in code review.

Out of scope for this checklist: cloud sync, remote login, remote protection, and other network-dependent features.

Legend: `[ ]` pending · `[x]` done · `[-]` deferred (with reason) · `[!]` blocked on something
