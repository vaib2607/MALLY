# Avelo Master PRD

The single source of truth for product behaviour. Every screen, every field, every keyboard shortcut, every error message. This document is normative; code must conform to it.

## 0. Product definition

Avelo is a 100% offline native macOS desktop accounting application for Indian small businesses, built with Swift 5.9, SwiftUI, and SQLite. It is a simplified, keyboard-driven alternative to TallyPrime, with all entries made manually by a human on a keyboard. It runs entirely on the user's Mac, never connects to the internet, and never sends any data anywhere. Every monetary figure, every quantity, every rate is typed by the user. The system of record is a local SQLite file per company. The app is a digital ledger with strict double-entry validation, not an automated ERP.

## 1. Non-negotiables (summary; full text in `Avelo_Rules.md`)

- 100% offline. No `URLSession`. No third-party network libraries. No analytics.
- Money is `Int64` paise everywhere. Never `Double`.
- Every voucher: `Σ debits == Σ credits` before commit. Enforced in service and at SQL trigger.
- No silent deletion. Reversal, disable, end-date only.
- Audit events are append-only.
- Financial-year locks are enforced at SQL trigger level.
- Inventory is optional and is never silently auto-linked.
- Multi-company, one SQLite file per company, isolated.

## 2. User personas

- **Single proprietor / small business owner** running a manufacturing unit, trading house, or service business in India.
- **Accountant** working for the above, entering day-to-day vouchers.
- **Auditor** (read-only use in MVP; audit log viewer + report drill-down).

The app is single-user, offline, and assumes the user is comfortable with a Tally-style keyboard-driven workflow.

## 3. Glossary

| journal | no | no | `JV/<fy>/<5-digit>` |
| sales | yes (debtor/asset account) | no | `S/<fy>/<5-digit>` |
| purchase | yes (creditor/liability account) | no | `P/<fy>/<5-digit>` |
| payment | yes (creditor or expense) | no | `PAY/<fy>/<5-digit>` |
| receipt | yes (debtor or income) | no | `RCT/<fy>/<5-digit>` |
| contra | yes (bank or cash) | no | `CON/<fy>/<5-digit>` |
| creditNote | yes (debtor) | yes | `CN/<fy>/<5-digit>` |

The "required party" rule is enforced as a soft warning by the validator. Hard fail only when the type is `creditNote`, `debitNote`, or `payroll`.

## 7. Screen-by-screen specification

### 7.1 CompanyPickerView (launch)

When the app starts and no company is active, this is the first view. It lists companies from the registry DB and offers "New Company" and "Open Backup".

- Layout: centered card. Logo placeholder on top, list of companies below, two buttons at the bottom.
- Empty state: "No companies yet. Click 'New Company' to get started."
- For each company: name, FY range, last opened date. Double-click to switch.
- Buttons: "New Company…" (primary), "Open Backup…" (secondary).
- "Open Backup" opens a file picker for `.avelobackup`. On confirm, calls `RestoreService.restore`.

Keyboard: `Enter` opens the highlighted company; `Cmd+N` triggers "New Company"; `Cmd+O` triggers "Open Backup".

### 7.2 CompanySetupView (wizard)

A 3-step wizard: Company details → Financial Year → Default chart of accounts choice.

**Step 1 — Company details**
- Company name (required, unique, max 120 chars)
- Address line 1, line 2, city, state, pincode, country (default India)
- GSTIN (optional, 15-char format check `##AAAAA####A#A#` if entered)
- PAN (optional, 10-char format check `AAAAA####A` if entered)
- Base currency: INR (read-only)
- Inventory enabled: toggle, default off
- Inventory link mode: dropdown (`manual`, `autoPrompt`, `autoSilent`); default `autoPrompt`; greyed out if inventory is off

**Step 2 — Financial year**
- Label: e.g. `2025-26` (auto-suggested from today's date)
- Start date: defaults to 1 April of the suggested year; editable
- End date: defaults to 31 March of the next year; editable; must be exactly 365 or 366 days from start
- Books begin date: defaults to start date; editable; allowed to be later (e.g. company created in July 2025 → books begin on 1 July)
- Open FY (read-only checkbox, derived from is_locked)

**Step 3 — Default chart of accounts**
- Choice: "Seed with Avelo's default 13 groups + 28 ledgers" (recommended) or "Start empty"
- "Back" and "Create Company" buttons

**On Create:**
- Calls `CompanyService.create(companyInput:fyInput:seedDefaults:)` in one transaction.
- DB file is created, schema applied, default voucher types inserted, default groups + ledgers (or empty) inserted.
- Active company is set, active FY is set to the new one.
- Router navigates to the OpeningBalancesView.

### 7.3 FinancialYearSetupView (during onboarding)

Same as the FY step in CompanySetupView, but pre-filled with the current FY's values. Used in two contexts:
- During onboarding (after company is created, before opening balances).
- When a user wants to add a new FY mid-year (rare in MVP, but supported).

For MVP, this view is only used during onboarding. The "add new FY" workflow is in `Settings → Financial Years`.

### 7.4 OpeningBalancesView (wizard)

A table of every ledger, with two editable cells: opening balance (in rupees, formatted Indian grouping) and opening side (`Dr`/`Cr`). Defaults to 0/Dr. Save button is at the bottom.

- "Save opening balances" writes a single `opening` voucher per non-zero ledger, debiting the asset / crediting the liability/equity, and crediting/debiting a balancing "Opening Balance Equity" ledger. The balancing ledger is auto-created on first use and pinned to the CAPITAL group.
- "Skip" leaves balances at 0.
- On save success, navigate to Dashboard.

### 7.5 DashboardView

Top of the home screen. The active company name, active FY range, and today's date in the header.

Tiles (4 across, 2 rows on standard windows):
- **Cash position** — sum of all bank + cash account balances, displayed as a single figure.
- **Receivables** — total balance of all `Sundry Debtors` sub-ledgers (if any).
- **Payables** — total balance of all `Sundry Creditors` sub-ledgers.
- **This month's P&L** — net profit for the current calendar month, with arrow up/down.
- **Stock value** — total value of all stock items (if inventory enabled).
- **Open vouchers** — count of unposted drafts (always 0 in MVP, since drafts are not yet a feature).
- **Audit events (last 7 days)** — count.
- **Backup reminder** — "Last backup: X days ago" or "You haven't backed up in 30 days".

Each tile is clickable and navigates to the relevant report or list.
